# Hey there! üê∂

Welcome to our Design System, serving as a foundation for the entire web project - "SterczƒÖce Uszy".

It's designed to bring consistency to our pages and speed up the development process.

## Structure

This Design System follows the [Atomic Design 2.0 methodology](https://medium.com/@hannah.heinson/atomic-2-0-d94e5601200c) which allows us to create a well-structured and scalable system.

Here's how we organize our elements:

1. **Tokens** - these are foundational styles that form the building blocks of our design system. They cannot be broken down further and provide consistency throughout the interface.
2. **Components** - the most basic interface elements, components are small and distinct. They are the building blocks of our UI and can be easily reused in various contexts.
3. **Patterns** - they're combinations of two or more components, like cards or accordions, which work together to create more complex and functional elements.
4. **Blocks** - they're relatively more complex components that can function on their own, forming distinct sections of our interface. They provide flexibility and can be reused across different designs or layout templates.

## Explore

We have provided detailed documentation for all elements in our Design System.

Each element comes with its own canvas tab, allowing you to find all the properties and play around with them in real-time for instant changes.
